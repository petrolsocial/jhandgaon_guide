              'It\'s an eerily quiet night in Jhandgaon. Quiet isn\'t the norm here - it\'s usually a precursor to something really jhand. On one such soon to jhand night, our heroes of questionable moralities sit around a fire at Amma\'s Dhaba. Amma\'s Dhaba is a respite (or exile = depends on who you ask), on the left most outskirts of Jhandgaon. All sorts of seedy and needy characters sift through Amma\'s Dhaba, some exiting Jhandgaon and some yet to enter Jhandgaon. \nTonight Amma\'s Dhaba only has our heroes. Circled across the fire. Each in deep thought. Their deep thoughts are soon interrupted by 2 bandits leaping out from bushes, armed heavily with as set of rifles and waxed moustaches respectively.\nThe Director thrusts the heroes into combat at this stage. Once the bandits have either been captured or killed - the plot and background of the campaign is revealed (By the bandits - if captured. By an angry Amma who enters scene after the fight - if bandits are killed).\n',
          'The Plot Thickens':
              'It is revealed to our heroes that the bandits are assassins. Sent to finish off our heroes, the remnant leaders of the Eagle gang. The Eagle gang being a longstanding rival of Bichoo/Scorpion gang. Power over the drug trade (hence Jhandgaon) has shifted hands across both gangs over decades. Bichoo gang is the current supreme, their ruthless leader Chaku has assassinated the Eagle Gang boss (nameless, for now) in a cold, cowardly way earlier in the night. The Plot Thickens.\n\nThe petty dacoits were meant to finish off our heroes too, but they\'ve triumphed so far. This fuels their thirst for revenge and to restore Eagle gang to glory after such disrespect.\n',
          'Revelations and Forking paths':
              'Further lines of interrogation can reveal one or both things.\n\n- The dacoits have come from the dacoit camp north of Amma\'s Dhaba. The camp is mostly unguarded since the dacoits are working as hired mercenaries for Chaku tonight. The camp has arms and vehicles.\n\n- Bichoo gang leader, Chaku, after this power play aims to move a huge shipment of drugs tonight in a few hours, another power palay that will cement hime and Bichoo gang as a crime monarch instead of a volatile duopoly with Eagle gang. The route is from the quarry/gang head quarters/drug processing centre to the Outcast (out caste) Village.\n',
          'Raiding the Raiders':
              'If our heroes have opted to explore the dacoit camp, then this is relevant. Else skip to 4.2.\n\nThe dacoit camp is deep in the jungles. It is a small clearing with a bunch of tarp tents. There are 2 men around a fire on guard, in the middle of the camp. \n\nBig tent 1: This tent seems to be the living quarters of the dacoit leader. There are multiple dacoit uniforms here. A locked chest with some arms, money, and love letters from the dacoit\'s love interest. \n\nBig tent 2: This is the armory tent. It is guarded by a huge, scary dog. The dog is however tied on a leash. It has the following items:\n- guns (few assault, lots of pistol, few automatics, lots of rifles)\n- swords\n- knives \n- Some grenades\n- Blue drums full of some chemical (Director\'s discretion what it is - options are kerosene, acid, chemical for biowareface, etc.) \n\nOpen tent 1: Has 2 open Jeeps/Thars. They\'re covered by huge sheets of plastic, so can\'t be seen until uncovered by heroes.\n\nOpen tent 2: Seems to be another living quarter. has the right hand man of dacoit leader, Sabu. If this tent is approached then he attacks our characters.\n',
          'Seeking Revenge':
              'Our heroes rush to intercept the Scorpion gang on their route.\n\nMost heroes either set a trap for the incoming gang or go to direct confrontation. \n\nThe interception can be at ay point on the route. The scenery will have dense bushes, few mud huts, a tapri or a man on a cycle selling cigarettes and tea. \n\nThe scorpion gang entourage has:\n- 2 guys on bikes who are travelling ahead to clear the path\n- A large truck with a driver and muscleman up front and 2 men protecting cargo load behind.\n- A sleek black car with driver + muscleman for protection up front and Scorpion leader in the backseat.\n\nThe trap and/or showdown that then happens between both gangs is completely improv. \n\nThe Scorpion leader is wearing a bulletproof vest, but a sleeveless one since he likes to dress nice. He wears dense black shades at all times even at night. And has a comically deep voice, almost as if it\'s fake.\n\nThe game ends with Scorpion leader\'s death. The game can continue however on a completely improv basis.\n',

            'Veerappan sits in his tent quarters pondering about his traumatic past. Lately his painful memories have been revived. As he sits deep in thought, stroking the huge scar on his face… a man bursts through the tent entrance! He is in a disheveled and maimed state. He falls to Veerappans feet. He narrates how his attempt to scout the Sundari camp has failed. He further goes on to profusely apologise, and thus illustrates how he should be punished since this scout mission was important. After 2 decades, Veerappan has finally discovered the massacre of his family was done by Sri Sri Sundari Maa - he has a name & face for his revenge. The scout was supposed to survey the compound and return with more information so veraappan can decide what to do next.\n\nSimultaneously (next turn), we shift to the Sundari compound. Sundari Maa sits on her chaise lounge on an elaborate marble pedestal. Wulfiqar’s handler enters the compound and tells Sundari Maa that Wulfiqar attacked a man trying to enter the compound. Scraps of paper that fell from the man’s pocket show that this was related to Veerappan. \n\nWulfiqar is annoyed he wasn’t allowed to eat that scrawny guy. It wasn’t like he was a compound man, and the guy smelled a lot too. Seems like wherever etc are from, people didn’t shower a whole lot. He yearns to eat whole humans & seethes internally again at his forced servitude to Sundari Maa. \n\nPanditji is in his headquarters, a sleek glass 10-storey building. He runs his cult like an efficient business and their operational premises could blend in with any corporate office. Across all the cubicles, glass, steel, white light - he sits in in his huge corner office. Flanked by men in black suits and magenta gamchas. Elections are a week away and his strategy to villainises the naxals led by Veerappan is going well. But as a final push they need to, build a new prayer centre. A prayer centre right next to the lake, whose property prices won’t increase till the naxals are eliminated.\n\n2 birds, 1 huge profit. Pandu ji giggles.\n\nIf Umrao Jaan is in play, then this is her intro:\nThe Jhand-e-man headquarters are strewn with posters, buntings, flags, and more. The party symbol and Umrao Jaan’s face covers every surface. This year’s elections have been harder than most. It should have been a cakewalk if not for the unexpected adversaries & hurdles.\n\nUmrao Jaan sits on her party president kursi. She has just had an annoying phone call with Pandu ji.  She doesn’t appreciate how she’s been asked to handle & pay off Sundari Maa, so that wench can eliminate Veerappan for them.\n\nShe ponders on her arrangement with Pandu ji. It has been a solid arrangement so far. Her political clout & his business-like cult (or was it a cult-like business?) have been able to net them money and maintain power. But lately, Pandu ji seems to have become too much of a heavy weight. She doesn’t like it.\n\nBut for now Umrao Jaan, now calls up Sundari Maa, to proceed as instructed.\n',
        'The Plot Thickens':
            'The next set of events are completely improv. The objective of the DM is to set up situations that will make or break alliances between these factions. At some point, you have to coax players gently into a showdown of sorts at any of the 3 locations (Naxal camp, Sundari compound, Pandu ji HQ) where one group wins the struggle for power.\nPossibilities:\n- A set-up which makes Wulfiqar turn on Sundari Maa (something breaks his spell) & he sides with Veerappan now to take her down\n- A rift between Pandu ji & Sundari Maa - could be romantic or financial in nature\n- Veerappan convinces Pandu ji to side with him & take out Sundari Maa\n- Umrao Jaan backstabs Pandu ji over the initial phone call itself\n',
